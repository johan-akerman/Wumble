# 💻 Wumble
This is where it all started... After learning the basics of programming and web development on Codecademy and Youtube I decided to launch Wumble, my own web agency. I sent out 1000+ emails to random businesses I found online before landing my first client. I learned how to manage projects, design and code as I took on new projects for small businesses during my spare time in high-school. 

## ⚙️ Technologies used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Adobe XD.
